 * @{
 * @brief Definitions and prototypes for the HEALTH interface.
 *
 * @details The Goodix UART Service is a customized GATT-based service with Tx, Rx and Flow Control
 *          characteristics. The application uses the service to send and receive data to and
 *          from the peer. The application data is sent to the peer as Handle Value Notification,
 *          and the data received from the peer is transmitted with GATT Write Command.
 *
 *          After \ref health_init_t variable is initialized , the application must call \ref health_service_init()
 *          to add the Goodix Uart Service and Rx, Tx, Flow Control characteristics to the BLE Stack
 *          database. The application can send the data to the peer with \ref health_tx_data_send() after
 *          \ref HEALTH_EVT_TX_PORT_OPENED received. The application should copy the received data to its own buffer
 *          when handling \ref HEALTH_EVT_RX_DATA_RECEIVED.
